## Response:
I'll help you fix the cart visibility issue in the mobile view by modifying the navigation section in base.html. I'll add the cart to the mobile menu view.

Click to open text

I've made the following improvements to make the cart visible and accessible on mobile:

1.  Added a cart link to the mobile menu that appears when the hamburger menu is clicked
2.  Included the cart icon along with the text "Keranjang" for better visibility
3.  Maintained the cart count badge functionality in the mobile view
4.  Styled the mobile cart link to match the other mobile menu items
5.  Made sure the cart badge is positioned correctly relative to the cart icon

The cart is now accessible in three ways:

*   On desktop: visible in the top navigation bar
*   On mobile: accessible through the hamburger menu
*   The cart count badge remains visible in both views

The cart will now be fully accessible on mobile devices while maintaining a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application. Users can access it by tapping the hamburger menu icon and then tapping the cart link in the mobile menu.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the mobile cart styling or layout?
