## Prompt:
sekarang tolong buat animasi yang simple saja saat di tekan button filling,

implementasi dengan best pracitce , dan performane first karena akan di run di rasbery pi

## Response:
I'll help you create a simple and performance-optimized filling animation by modifying the MachineWidget class. We'll use a QTimer for animation and keep things minimal to ensure good performance on Raspberry Pi.

Updated MachineWidget with Filling Animation

Click to open code

I've made several optimizations for better performance on Raspberry Pi:

1.  Used simple text-based animation (●/○ characters) instead of complex graphics
2.  Minimal use of opacity/transparency effects
3.  Efficient QTimer usage with 100ms intervals (10 FPS) which is sufficient for this animation
4.  No complex calculations or memory-intensive operations
5.  Reuse of existing widgets rather than creating new ones
6.  Minimal state changes and redraws

To implement this, replace the existing MachineWidget class in your code with this new version. The animation will:

1.  Show a progress bar using circle characters
2.  Change the indicator color during filling
3.  Disable the button during filling
4.  Emit a signal when filling is complete

The timing is set to complete in about 1.5 seconds (15 segments × 100ms), but you can adjust this by changing the timer interval or number of segments.

You can connect to the filling\_completed signal in your main app to trigger any additional actions when filling is done:

```python
# In WaterSustainabilityApp:
self.machine_widget.filling_completed.connect(self.on_filling_completed)

def on_filling_completed(self):
    print("Filling completed!")
    # Add any additional actions here
```

These changes should provide a smooth experience even on lower-powered hardware like the Raspberry Pi.

## Prompt:
saya bingung tolong berikan saya full updated class dari MachineWidget

## Response:
I'll help you with a complete, updated version of the MachineWidget class that includes the animation functionality.

Complete Updated MachineWidget Class

Click to open code

This updated class includes:

1.  Clear organization with separate methods for creating UI components
2.  Simple text-based animation using circles (● and ○)
3.  A progress indicator that changes color during filling
4.  A timer-based animation system
5.  Methods to start, update, complete, and reset the filling process
6.  Signal emission when filling completes

To use this in your main application, simply replace your existing MachineWidget class with this one. The widget will:

*   Show an animated progress bar when filling starts
*   Disable the start button during filling
*   Change colors to indicate status
*   Emit a signal when filling completes

If you want to handle the completion in your main app, you can connect to the signal like this:

```python
# In your WaterSustainabilityApp class:
self.machine_widget.filling_completed.connect(self.on_filling_completed)

def on_filling_completed(self):
    print("Filling process completed!")
    # Add any additional actions here
```

This implementation is optimized for Raspberry Pi performance by:

1.  Using simple text characters instead of complex graphics
2.  Minimizing redraws and state changes
3.  Using a reasonable animation timer interval (100ms)
4.  Avoiding complex calculations
5.  Minimizing memory usage
