Hello! How can I help you today?

## Prompt:
cara abis filling, buat thank you popup selama beberapa detik gmn ? bagus nya gmn pakai gif kah ? atau gmn ? ini di jalankan di rasbery pi , yang optimal gmn ?

dan beri tahu di update dimana saja

## Response:
I'll help you add a thank you popup after filling completion. For a Raspberry Pi, it's best to use a simple QDialog with a static image rather than GIF to ensure smooth performance.

Thank You Dialog

Click to open code

Now, let's update the necessary parts of the code to implement this:

1.  In the MachineWidget class, modify complete\_filling():

Thank You Dialog

Click to open code

You'll need to:

1.  Add a "success.png" image to your project directory
2.  Import the ThankYouDialog class at the top of your file
3.  Update the imports section:

Thank You Dialog

Click to open code

This implementation provides a simple, performant solution that works well on Raspberry Pi. It shows a clean thank you message with an icon for 3 seconds before automatically closing.

If you prefer text only without an image for even better performance, just remove the icon-related code from the ThankYouDialog class.
